Action Plan Project 4

 X 1) Class/struct for point light source (including ambient, diffuse, specular, color, intensity)

 X 2) Class/struct for material properties (color, ambient, diffuse, specular)

http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent/classes/581/Lectures/12.IlluminationHandout.pdf

 X 3) Implement the illumination for basic objects
	3a) separate parameters for ambient, diffuse, and specular components
	3b) add another light source

4) Define sphere objects (create a class defining a sphere, based on quads)
	4a) code to find first intersection of a ray with a sphere

5) Define two more object types (triangles and infinite planes)
	5a) triangle
	5b) infinite plane
	5c) two more object types


6) Define a ray class/struct (origin, direction, light source, depth)

7) Find first intersection of a ray with an object in the scene (a method)
	-iterate through objects and find which point it intersects one first
	7a) Generate reflected ray based on that intersection

8) implement recursive ray tracing
