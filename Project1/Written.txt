Q1

You have an array of vertices. What would you need to do to produce an object representation using vertex indices?  How would the original array change?  What additional data structures would you need?

Answer
---------
I can add an index array which stores integers that correspond to different vertices in the vertex array. Each conceptual "row" (probably separated by -1 indicators) corresponds to a 2-Dimensional face of the object. The original vertex array doesn't need to be changed at all.



Q2

You want 3 views of the same scene, each taking up 1/4 of the screen. These three views should show the front, side and top views of the object. Describe in words what needs to be done with the viewport and camera to accomplish this. How does this affect the viewing frustum?

Answer
---------
I don't see why anything would need to change. Additional cameras would just be added. I'm assuming these cameras are invisible.
